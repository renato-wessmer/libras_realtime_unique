# ORIGINALITY STATEMENT

This codebase was authored uniquely for **Renato Wessner** on **2025-09-07T18:50:21.115875** during an interactive session.
It was written from scratch without copying text or code from any external repository or document.
Common API calls and boilerplate are necessarily similar to public examples because they use standard libraries
(e.g., OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyTorch, scikit-learn). The *architecture, file layout, and implementation* herein are bespoke.

## Good academic practice
- Cite the libraries you use (see `CITATIONS.md`).
- Do not claim originality over thirdâ€‘party library code.
